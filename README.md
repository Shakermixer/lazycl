# lazycl
(in progress) Gaming-low-lag lazyEvaled form of opencl ndrange kernels, internally using lwjgl's opencl api for java. Each LazyBlob is a List of LazyBlob and replaces that List with the bitstring when lazyEval finishes. This is a refactoring of the working OpenclUtil code in humanAiNetNeural.
